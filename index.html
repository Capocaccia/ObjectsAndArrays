    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    
    team[3] = "Lux";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    var team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    
    var team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    
    var person = {
            age: 28,
            name: 'Carter',
        };

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    
    const captain = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // If you need to clone deep you need to find a clone deep function
    // You can also use the "poor mans" deep clone:
    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
